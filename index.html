  <h1>Rainy Day Ramblings</h1>
  <p class="date">April 18, 2025</p>

  <p>Rain is strangely reassuring. It's not the loud variety with thunder and lightning, but the gentle, insistent variety that taps at your window like it has a story to share.</p>

  <p>Today was just that kind of day. I made a cup of coffee (yes, two) and just sat back to watch the world quiet down and get slower a little bit. Funny how we are always in a hurry, yet on rainy days it's as if the world is cautioning us to simply slow down for a minute or two.</p>

  <blockquote>"Let the rain kiss you. Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops. Let the rain sing you a lullaby." – Langston Hughes</blockquote>

  <p>I don't usually write poetry, but rainy days make me want to say something. Or maybe it's just the coffee. Anyway, I wish for more quiet and rainy days.</p>
